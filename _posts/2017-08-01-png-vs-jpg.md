title: "Why saving in jpg can ruin your model"
---

A while back I was using SSD to detect game objects that had relatively smooth graphics. What I found was SSD worked great at telling apart different shaped objects but had trouble with differentiating objects that had the same shape but different color. Later I found, after carefully looking at image, that when saving in .jpg, even if you the quality is set to 100% in opencv, you still get some compression artifacts. I suspected that this compression artifacts played a role in confusing the network, so I redid my model this time using .png images. The result was a significant improvement. Checkout my forked git of [SSD-Tensorflow](http://github.io/walterwang/SSD-Tensorflow.git) if you want to try your model using .png.
