#戒骄戒躁来跟课

###⊙﹏⊙

一年好像要写几次戒骄戒躁，一想到好多事，就会着急，比如自己会死之类的，比如那么多时间被别人占有之类的，我是不是应该躲起来，I know someone are so meaningful and special to me, but I can't help to be selfish, like spend all of my time on my own things and only concern about myself.


我不该这样，看，我又开始用该不该这个词了（该 or 不该），该不该这件事，这个词不是老早就退出我的价值观，评判观，生活观么，像依萍一样，我的字典里没有‘该’这个字，应该是我想做什么事，那么我就去做，我不想做什么事，那就不做，这就是自由么。

长叹一口气，虽然我看起来是个好人，但是under specific（no，not specific）,under most cases, maybe I'm not a good guy.

Why we have to be societies? why cannot we just be a planet ourselves? we can fly/ rotate around each other, but never be too close or too far away?

Why the situation can not be like this?

Why we have to care about others?

Why we have to sacrifice ourselves？


Why can't we just be our pure selves and speak out what we think?
